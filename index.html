          I am passionate about Music, especially Pop, Folk, Jazz and Absolute Music. I‚Äòve been playing the piano for about 15 years, and I enjoy practicing the piano version of my favorite songs in my free time to relax. I am also interested in studying the background music of different kinds of movies.

          <h2>Club üíÉ</h2>
        <p>
            Due to Covid-19, I'm not able to participate in the club activities on campus, but before that, I was the founder and president of the Dance Club in my high school. My role was to design classes and act as leading instructor. At that time, I also publicized the club and recruit new members, negotiated with school leaders to obtain performance opportunities for my club to perform at art festivals, managed, budgeted and allocated the funds to buy necessities for weekly training and the performances.
